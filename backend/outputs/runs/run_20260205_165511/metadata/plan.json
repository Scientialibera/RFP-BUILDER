Underscore Aurelia\u2019s public-sector and utilities experience, formal delivery phases, and security/compliance engineering to reassure NFWB that all regulatory, contractual, and reporting obligations will be met without surprises. Demonstrate strong MWBE/SDVOB engagement and safety culture, and present a clear, realistic schedule that de-risks the critical path to 2023 construction and 2024 monitoring. Finally, show that Aurelia\u2019s documentation and visualization practices (including GIS-compatible outputs and clear diagrams) will make complex findings understandable for NFWB, NYSDEC, and the Water Board, supporting approvals and funding decisions."
