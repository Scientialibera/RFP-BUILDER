      "overview": "This proposal will position Aurelia Digital Systems as a specialized partner for secure, modern, Azure-centric digital delivery across enterprise and public-sector domains. The structure mirrors Aurelia\u2019s internal capabilities but is re-framed to directly answer implicit RFP-style requirements: technical capabilities, delivery approach, security and compliance, technology stack, quality and governance, experience, and team model. High-weight mandatory requirements are front-loaded and repeatedly reinforced, while medium/low-priority differentiators deepen credibility and show maturity.",
