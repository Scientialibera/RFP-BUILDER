  "win_strategy": "To win, the proposal must make it effortless for evaluators to see that Aurelia is fully compliant, technically superior, and low-risk. The plan emphasizes: (1) a meticulous requirements traceability matrix so no mandatory item is missed; (2) a clearly staged methodology for all eight Phase 1 tasks that aligns with NYSDEC\u2019s Engineering Report Outline and the Consent Order schedule, de-risking NFWB\u2019s regulatory obligations; (3) a strong, named Project Manager and governance model that ensures responsive coordination with NFWB and NYSDEC; (4) data-driven prioritization of corrective actions, demonstrating maximum I&I reduction per dollar and transparent assumptions; (5) robust safety and public communication planning to minimize disruption during smoke testing and flow isolation; (6) a realistic, bar-chart schedule and detailed task/hour matrix that show we understand the work and can deliver within a not-to-exceed fee; and (7) a proactive MWBE/SDVOB and compliance posture, with all Appendix E forms, insurance, indemnification, and statutory certifications clearly addressed. Visual tools (Mermaid diagrams, charts, and tables) are used throughout to make complex technical and schedule content quickly understandable and scoreable, differentiating our proposal for clarity, completeness, and professionalism."
